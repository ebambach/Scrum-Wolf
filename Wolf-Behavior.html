    <h1>Behavior</h1>
    <h2>How does a wolf get food?</h2>
    <p>In order to obtain the meat that a wolf consumes, a wolf will work together with it's pack.  The pack typically seeks out a herd of animals, in order to choose their meal.  This is done by observing the herd, checking for any signs of weakness, and pursuing the chosen target away from it's fellows.  Once the victim has been separated from the herd, the pack does it best to feed upon the prey.  Depending on the condition of the target, some members of the pack may suffer injury or death in their quest for food.</p>
    <h2>How does the pack communicate?</h2>
    <p>Within a family of wolves, communication helps maintain social stability. It helps to reinforce pack solidarity and enables the opportunity for young pack members to learn information specific to the pack and how to survive. Communication is also used to express an individual’s intentions or emotional disposition or feelings. As with any highly social animal, communication amongst wolves is particularly complex and involved and it is vital to keeping the family functioning together as one. Wolves do use a range of vocalizations to “talk” to one another and express themselves, but much of how they communicate is done through body language and even the chemistry of scent.</p>
    <h2>How does a wolf defend itself?</h2>
    <p>As with hunting, a wolf will collaborate with it's pack to defend a range of territory against predators and other wolf packs.  Wolves use their body scent to mark their territory by urinating. Wolves have scent glands in their paws and they will use their paws to place their scent for others to smell.</p>
    <h2>What are a wolf's sleeping habits like?</h2>
    <p>Wolves are nocturnal, requiring a pack to sleep together during the day, while they wake up at night to pursue prey.</p>
