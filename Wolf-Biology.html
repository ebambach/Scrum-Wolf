    <h2>What is a wolf's body structure like?</h2>
    <ul>
    	<li>Large Brain Capacity – Skull capacity allows adequate space for an advanced cerebral cortex (brain) necessary for coordinating group social activity.</li>
    	<br>
		<li>Skeleton – The skeleton of the wolf is well adapted to its lifestyle. Their bones need to be strong, for power in bringing down large prey such as caribou, deer, elks or moose. The narrow collarbones, interlocked foreleg bones and specially adapted wrist-bones give the wolf streamlining, strength and speed. The radius and ulna bones are ‘locked’ in position. This inability to rotate the forelimbs gives superb stability when running.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Fur – The wolf has two layers of fur. On top is a longer course fur used as guard hairs which keeps the wolf dry. The other is short under fur that keeps it warm.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Muzzle – A wolf has two hundred million smelling cells inside its nose and can smell 100 times better than a human being. A wolf has 42 teeth including four canines. Wolves use their sharp teeth to wound, grab and kill its prey.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Height / Weight – up to 2.5 feet tall, 6 feet length, 80-120 pounds</li>
		<br>
		<li>Lifespan – up to 6 years in the wild
		<br>
	</ul>
